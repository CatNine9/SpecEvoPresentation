var species_description = "Small mammalian carnivores with excellent hunting abilities, stealth and agility. Their small dainty paws have retractable claws, tucked away for silent walking when stalking, but released when pinning prey or climbing up trees after birds and mice. Their large eyes can see clearly in the night-time darkness, even if only by starlight. Their hunting of small rodents coupled with their affectionate, playful nature and almost humanlike facial proportions made them one of the most popular human pets.\n\nDomestic cats come in many shapes and sizes, not all suited for survival without human assistance. On Planet Cat Sanctuary, any cat that could not survive was assisted by the ship robots with food, shelter and medical care. However, they were ultimately selected against and their genes would not persist in the future. Instead, cats without any special care needs took over the planet.\n\nDomestic cats can survive well in solitude and some individuals may prefer it, but cats are overall social creatures that form colonies. The colonies are loose-knit groups that keep lookout for each other (on E-arth against bigger predators, but here, just against outsider cats)."
