var species_ecology = "Small grain-eater and insectivore, the latter especially so in infancy. Common prey of cats because even though they can fly, they are often taken by surprise on the ground when feeding, drinking, bathing or foraging."
var species_description = "Small passerines of inconspicuous colouration, though the males are slightly more contrasting and striking, with reds, whites and greys, compared to the more sandy and brown speckled female. They are semi-social, benefiting from the lookout of other birds. Females keep backup male suitors in mind, in case their current mate should meet a premature end or turn out to be a poor mate. Usually found inside large shrubs, but may venture onto the ground or up trees also.\n\nBack on Earth, these birds had reached a global distribution with the exception of the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Closely associted with human habitation, they were a common sight in gardens, streets, parks and shrubby areas, as well as farms and fields. Sometimes they were evn found in inner city areas where many other animals found difficulty surviving."
